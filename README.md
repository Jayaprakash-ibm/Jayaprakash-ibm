# 👋 Hi, I'm Jayaprakash

I'm a systems programmer currently working at **IBM Red Hat**, where I contribute to the development of the **Ceph distributed storage system**, particularly in the **BlueStore** storage backend.

I enjoy working close to the metal – in **C/C++**, diving into **operating systems internals**, **debugging tools**, and **high-performance storage systems**. I’m passionate about clean system design, performance optimization, and writing reliable, maintainable low-level code.
